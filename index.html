  <div class="title"><h1>Additional Information</h1></div>
  <div class="hobbies">
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p id="head">Music:</p>
    <p>I believe I have one of the most unusual tastes in music. The music I listen to ranges from Metal to various forms of house music to Irish music. I used play the drums and make covers in my basement to many different songs, and now prefer to just listen and sometimes try to learn piano.</p>
    
    <p id="head">Video Games:</p>
    <p>I enjoy playing video games competitively in some way. Recently I have been speedrunning single player games to beat them as quickly as possible. I also spend time experimenting with game development using Unity. I have taken a break to improve my over all programming skills and will go back once I am satisfied with the languages I am currently learning.</p>

    <p id="head">Golf:</p>
    <p>I rarely play golf myself, but I enjoy it when I do. I find golf to be a very interesting game because there is so much down time, but to be good at the game it takes a lot of mental energy. It also gives me a good opportunity to find new places to travel to.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="travel">
    <h2>Travel</h2>
    <p id="head">Traveled to Ireland, Scotland, London, Colorado, Hawaii, Arizona and many other locations</p>
    <p id="head">My favorite locations to travel to tend to be areas with mountains. This is mostly because of the scenery, but it may also have to do with the fact that I don't really enjoy the beach. However I still enjoy tropical areas.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="goals" id="goals">
  <div class="title"><h1>Goals</h1></div>
  <div id="long-term">
    <h2>Long-term</h2>
    <p>My main goal is to end up in Silicon Valley as a software engineer. I currently spend most of my time studying and applying for jobs hoping to eventually reach this goal.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="short-term">
      <h2>Short-term</h2>
      <p id="head">I am currently working on a satire news website that will be run by friends of mine. They will upload articles and comics of their choice and users will be able to make accounts to receive newsletters and choose favorite articles.</p>
      <p id="head">A relatively new goal of mine is to become an indie game developer. I have a few ideas that I would like to follow through with some day.</p>
